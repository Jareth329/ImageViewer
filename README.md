# ImageViewer
 
### Controls
L-mouse : pan

M-mouse : rotate

R-mouse : reset

Scroll : zoom

T-key : toggle titlebar visibility

H-key : toggle ui visibility (currently just counter)

L-arrowkey : change to previous image in current folder

R-arrowkey : change to next image in current folder

> arrowkeys will both loop back to other side when end is reached

ESC or F8 : exit program

F10 : toggle maximized

### Notes
- rotation and zoom are both relevant to the center of the window, not the center of the image
- drag and drop an image into program from file system to view it (jpeg/png/bmp/dds/ktx/exr/hdr/tga/svg/webp should have some level of support currently)
