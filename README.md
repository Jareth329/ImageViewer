# ImageViewer
 
### Controls
L-mouse : pan

M-mouse : rotate

R-mouse : reset

Scroll : zoom

### Notes
- rotation and zoom are both relevant to the center of the window, not the center of the image
- drag and drop an image into program from file system to view it (jpeg/png/bmp/dds/ktx/exr/hdr/tga/svg/webp should have some level of support currently)
